TO RUN THE BENCHMARKS:

GCC:

  to run: 		./sim-cache -redir:prog cc.myout -config cache-config/cache-lru.cfg benchmarks/cc1.pisa-big -O benchmarks/1stmt.i
  to test output:	diff benchmarks/1stmt.s benchmarks/1stmt.s.ref


COMPRESS95:

  to run:		./sim-cache -redir:prog compress95.myout -config cache-config/cache-lru.cfg benchmarks/compress95.pisa-big < benchmarks/compress95.in
  to test output:	diff compress95.myout benchmarks/compress95.out


GO:

  to run:		./sim-cache -redir:prog go.myout -config cache-config/cache-lru.cfg benchmarks/go.pisa-big 50 9 benchmarks/2stone9.in
  to test output:	diff go.myout benchmarks/go.out


Additional Notes:
----------------

  * Change the configuration file as needed.
  * Compare your generated output with the one provided. Be aware that when you don't run a benchmark to completion,
    (i.e., when you limit the number of instructions to simulate by the max:inst flag) only a part of the reference output will be generated.
